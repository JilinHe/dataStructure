1c. Does your ECHashStringSet look roughly linear or roughly quadratic
in its scaling behavior for random strings?
    Linear. When doubling the scale, my ECHashStringSet's time complexity doubles as well.

2c. Does your **BST**StringSet look roughly linear or roughly
quadratic in its scaling behavior for in order strings?
    Linear. When doubling the scale, my BSTStringSet's time complexity doubles as well

Before submitting, make sure that your ECHashStringSet is capable of
handling inputs of size 1000000 in a reasonable amount of time (a few
seconds).
